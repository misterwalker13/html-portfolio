<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Emery and I am a New York based web developer. Welcome to the first site that I have built since high school, and it's crazy how little has changed since I began this journey however many years ago.

<p>When not behind a computer, you can find me behind a piano or searching for new or used vinyl records to add to my collection. I also love traveling around the world looking for records, so let me know if there are any must-see shops in your area. Food is also another passion of mine, as well as cooking, so I am always down for a to go out of the way for something amazing.</p>

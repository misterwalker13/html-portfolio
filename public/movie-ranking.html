<h1>The Best Movies According to Emery</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>This is by-far my favorite! I can watch it with no audio and still know what's going on.</p>

<h3>Ray</h3>
<p>Simultaneously tragic and inspiring. Jamie Foxx is amazing playing Ray Charles. </p>
